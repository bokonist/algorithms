my implementations of common algorithms and useful data structures


## INDEX OF CONTENTS
  1. **advanced-data-structures**
      1. graphs
          * BFS (breadth first search)
          * DFS (depth first search)
      2. trees
          * segment-tree
          * tries
  2. **backtracking**
      * nqueens-backtracking
      * nqueens-branch_and_bound
      * all-paths-in-a-maze
      * sudoku-solver
  3. **bit-manipulation**
      * generateK-SetBits (generates numbers with k bits set in their binary form)
      * powerOfTwo (finds the closest power of two to a number in both directions)
      * numberOfSetBits (counts the number of set bits in a binary number O(number of set Bits) algorithm )
  4. **combinatronics**
      * combinations (generates combinations of a string/array)
      * permutation (generates permutations of a string/array)
      * subsets (generates all possible subsets of a string/array)
  5. **greedy**
      * 0-1knapsack (classic 0-1 knapsack problem using George Dantzig's greedy approach)
  6. **numbers**
      * baseconversion (convert a decimal to any base)
      * fermats-little-theorem-primality-test (primality test using fermat's little theorem. higher complexity (number of tests) gives higher accuracy)
      * fermat's integer factorization
      * Pollard Rho Integer factorization
      * largest prime factor of a (long long int) number
  7. **sorting**
      * selectionsort
      * bubblesort
      * countsort
      * mergeSort
      * quickSort
      * radixsort
      * insertionsort
